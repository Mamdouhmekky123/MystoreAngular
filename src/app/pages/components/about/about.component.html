    An e-commerce website made by students in their graduation year as a
    graduation project is a comprehensive platform that requires a significant
    amount of planning, designing, and development. The website needs to be
    built with the latest technologies and trends in mind to ensure that it is
    robust, secure, and scalable. The students need to consider various factors
    such as user experience, user interface, security, and payment processing
    when designing and developing the website.

    The e-commerce website typically includes a product catalogue that displays
    all the products available for purchase. The product catalogue needs to be
    well-organized with clear descriptions, images, and pricing information.
    This allows customers to browse through the available products and select
    the ones they are interested in purchasing.
    <br />
    <br />
    Another critical feature of an e-commerce website is the shopping cart. The
    shopping cart allows customers to add products to their cart and proceed to
    checkout when they are ready to make a purchase. The checkout process needs
    to be simple and straightforward to ensure that customers do not abandon
    their carts due to a complicated checkout process.
    <br />
    <br />
    Finally, the website needs to have an order management system that allows
    the website owner to manage orders, track shipments, and process refunds if
    necessary. This system should also provide real-time updates to customers
    regarding the status of their orders.
